# About and public updates

Version 1.0.3 checks and downloads releases without a GitHub account, access key,
token, or sign-in. Open **About → Check for updates**. About also shows the
installed version, recorded installation/update date, platform, and last check.

## Check and download

The public update endpoint is
[Wgeshow/optical-design-studio-downloads](https://github.com/Wgeshow/optical-design-studio-downloads).
Anyone can access its published installer assets. The desktop app sends no
authorization header, reads no saved GitHub credentials, and does not contact
the private development repository. Browser sign-in is not required.

Checks run only when requested. The client verifies the expected public
repository, ignores drafts and pre-releases, compares numeric versions, and
selects the matching platform package. Empty releases, incompatible packages,
offline connections, GitHub rate limits, and invalid metadata have separate
statuses; none is reported as up to date.

**Download update** appears beside Check when a newer compatible package is
available. Choose a destination folder, follow progress, or cancel. HTTPS,
GitHub's published SHA-256 asset digest, and the expected file size protect
download integrity. Existing files in the destination are preserved. The app
offers **Open download folder** after success; run the installer when ready.
This release does not install updates or restart the application automatically.

Simulation and optimization can continue during checks and downloads. Closing
the application cancels an active update request and waits for the worker to
finish before saving and closing. Existing project/material/results libraries
remain local and are not uploaded by the updater.

Versions 1.0.2 and earlier need an installer upgrade to receive this public,
key-free updater. This version does not use or delete credentials remembered by
an older version. Users can remove an old OpticalDesignStudio/GitHub entry from
Windows Credential Manager themselves if one was previously saved.

## Separate public downloads and private development

GitHub visibility applies to an entire repository. A branch cannot be public
inside a private repository. Therefore the two repositories have different roles:

- **Public downloads:** `Wgeshow/optical-design-studio-downloads` contains release
  instructions, installer assets, and checksums. Its Git history does not
  contain the application development tree.
- **Private development:** `Wgeshow/optical-design-studio-updates` contains the
  application source, tests, build recipes, and development history. Use `test`
  for experiments and pull requests into `main` for stable changes.

Keeping a GitHub repository private does not make files bundled inside a public
installer private. The current GPL PyQt6/S4 distribution includes corresponding
readable source and third-party notices. Public packaging excludes research
libraries, credentials, local session files, and machine-specific build reports.
Do not publish a package until its source/data contents have been reviewed for
the intended distribution. No organization is used for either repository.

## Publish a release

1. Develop on `test`, run relevant tests, then review and merge into private `main`.
2. Update `APP_VERSION` and `BUILD_DATE` in `app_version.py`. Build and verify a
   public-profile installer from that reviewed source. Preserve the Inno AppId
   so an upgrade retains the installation and user library.
3. Save the matching full source archive and development tag in the private
   repository. Do not upload the private source archive to the public repository.
4. Create a public draft with a numeric stable tag such as `v1.0.3`, attach the
   tested installer and its checksum, and publish after reviewing the assets.
   Experimental builds must be marked pre-release.

Windows x64 assets must use exactly
`OpticalDesignStudio-Setup-<version>-Windows-x64.exe`, with the same version in
the release tag and executable metadata. GitHub must provide a SHA-256 digest
for the asset before the application offers it. Checksums verify file integrity;
they are not independent publisher signatures.

The Windows installer is x64. Linux requires its own native build and tested
package; Windows binaries do not run natively on Linux. Updater tests on Linux
do not constitute verification of the native Linux optical solver or installer.
